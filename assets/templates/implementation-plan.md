# Implementation Plan: [Feature Name]

## Technical Approach
Detailed description of the technical implementation strategy and how this feature fits into the existing system architecture.

## Implementation
Specific breakdown of feature into milestones, phases, and tasks. It is acceptable to use only tasks or only phases and tasks if the feature is sufficiently small enough to justify the lack of more granular organization.

### Milestone 1: Example milestone
Brief summary of milestone

#### Phase 1: Example phase
- [ ] Step 1: Create specific change with code example
```
+ # Example code change
- func(s string) {
+ func(s string) string {
     fmt.Println("Example")
+    return "Example"
  }
```
- [ ] Step 2: Run tests to ensure they still pass
- [ ] Step 3: Commit changes in git

#### Phase 2: Example follow-up phase
- [ ] Step 4: Step numbering continues between phases
- [ ] Step 5: Each step should include validating changes
