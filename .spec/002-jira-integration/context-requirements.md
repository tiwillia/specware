### Codebase Architecture Analysis

**Command Structure:**
- Uses Cobra CLI framework (github.com/spf13/cobra)
- Commands defined in `cmd/` package: root.go, feature.go, init.go, localize_templates.go
- Root command structure in `cmd/root.go:22-25` adds subcommands: initCmd, localizeTemplatesCmd, featureCmd

**Feature Command Pattern:**
- Feature commands in `cmd/feature.go` follow pattern: featureCmd.AddCommand() in init()
- Existing subcommands: new-requirements, new-implementation-plan, update-state
- All commands use `spec` package functions: `spec.CreateNewRequirements()`, `spec.UpdateFeatureStatus()`

**Internal Package Structure:**
- Core logic in `internal/spec/spec.go` 
- Functions follow pattern: validate input, handle filesystem operations, return created files list
- Error handling: return error with context using fmt.Errorf()
- File creation: uses os.WriteFile(), os.MkdirAll() with 0644/0755 permissions

**No HTTP Client Patterns Found:**
- Current codebase has no HTTP clients or external service integrations
- No existing patterns for API authentication or JSON parsing for external services
- Will need to add new dependencies for HTTP operations

**Dependencies:**
- Current: cobra CLI, ginkgo/gomega testing, embedded file system
- Missing for Jira integration: HTTP client library, JSON unmarshaling for Jira responses

**Testing Framework:**
- Uses Ginkgo v2 and Gomega for BDD-style testing
- Test files: `internal/spec/spec_test.go`, `internal/spec/spec_suite_test.go`

### Expert Questions

### Q6: Should the Jira integration validate environment variables at command startup?
**Answer:** Yes, validation should be limited to the fact that they are a non-empty string and nothing more. Do not add complex validation.

### Q7: Should the Jira issue data be output as structured JSON or formatted text?
**Answer:** No

### Q8: Should the integration support custom field extraction from Jira issues?
**Answer:** No, avoid complexity we aren't certain we need.

### Q9: Should network timeouts and retry logic be configurable?
**Answer:** No

### Q10: Should the command support outputting multiple issues in a single call?
**Answer:** No
