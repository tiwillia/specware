# Specware

Specware creates structured directories, commands, and templates and provides a tool to Claude Code to facilitate feature requirements gathering and implementation planning.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1. Install
```bash
$ go install github.com/tiwillia/specware@latest
```

### 2. Initialize Your Project
Navigate to your project directory, then initialize: 
```bash
# Initialize spec workflow in current directory
$ ./specware init .

# Optional: Create localized templates for customization
$ ./specware localize-templates
```

### 3. Start Feature Specification with Claude Code
```bash
# Open Claude Code and begin the spec-driven workflow
$ claude

# Use the /specify command to start gathering requirements
> /specify Add user authentication with email and password
```

The `/specify` command will guide you through:
- **Requirements gathering** - Interview-style Q&A to understand the feature
- **Expert research** - Codebase analysis and technical planning  
- **Implementation planning** - Detailed technical specifications to guide supervised implementation with Claude Code
- **(optional) Interactive Review** - Interactive review and amendment of each section of generated specifications
- **Status tracking** - Progress monitoring throughout development

Claude Code automatically uses the `specware` tool to create directories, track progress, and maintain organized specifications for your features.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

### Claude Commands and Agents
Once initialized, claude commands and agents are added to the project directory.

**You are expected to modify these as much as you'd like**.

The specify command controls the full workflow and how the specware tool is used. The agents provide specific expertise to the workflow. You and your project's team are in control of the workflow after initialization.

### Specification Templates
Templates used for the specification files in the workflow are not placed in the project by default, they are built-in to the command. It is possible to localize templates:
```
$ specware localize-templates
```

This will create a `.spec/templates` directory with the named templates. The `specware` tool will always look for the named templates in this directory first when creating specification files. The names should not be changed - changing the names will result in the tool using the built-in templates.

## üìö How it works

<details>
<summary>Details on the various components that make up the project</summary>  

### Overview

`specware` tool is used to set up a project repository for spec-driven development with un-intrusive directories and files ignored by git by default, then is used during interactive specification generation by Claude Code to facilitate filesystem and state tracking operations.

`/specify` claude command created in the project repository facilitates the interactive specification generation. The command is localized in the project to allow for project-specific customization.

`assets/templates/` are used as the base specifications Claude Code will fill out during specification generation. Templates can optionally be localized for project-specific customization.

`.spec/` directory created in the project repository provides a basic structure to organize generated specifications.

### Specware Tool

The `specware` tool is used for both project setup and during interactive specification generation.

After initialization, Specware creates in your project:

```
.claude/
  commands/
    specify.md                 # Claude Code workflow command
  agents/
    scope-creep-craig.md       # Agent for scope creep detection
    tech-spec-beck.md          # Agent for technical documentation
.spec/
  README.md                    # Spec workflow documentation  
```

#### Project Setup
These commands are intended to be run by a user:
- `init <directory>` - Initialize project with spec-driven workflow support
- `localize-templates` - Copy embedded templates to `.spec/templates/` for customization, not required.

#### Feature Management
These commands are intended to be run by Claude Code to facilitate feature specification:
- `feature new-requirements <short-name>` - Create new feature specification directory with requirements template
- `feature new-implementation-plan <short-name>` - Add implementation plan to existing feature
- `feature update-state <short-name> <status>` - Update feature development status

#### Jira Integration
These commands are intended to be run by Claude Code during the specification workflow to gather context from Jira:
- `jira get-issue <issue-key>` - Fetch and display a single Jira issue for context gathering

### Claude Command (/specify)

Interactive Claude Command with three primary workflows:

1. **Requirements Building:**
- Requirements gathering via Q&A
- Context gathering through codebase analysis  
- Expert Q&A with technical insights
- Requirements finalization
- Optional interactive review

2. **Technical Specification Creation:**
- Automated determination of useful technical specs (using tech-spec-beck agent)
- Generation of OpenAPI specs, data models, diagrams, etc.
- Interactive review and requirements integration

3. **Implementation Planning:**
- Codebase analysis for technical approach
- Implementation Q&A for technical details
- Plan generation with detailed tasks to guide supervised implementation with Claude Code
- Scope creep detection (using scope-creep-craig agent)
- Optional interactive review

Features state tracking and a one-question-at-a-time interview style with smart defaults.

The `/specify` command is a glorified prompt, you are expected to take advantage of the flexibility granted by Claude Code to modify the workflow, continue where you left off, skip steps, etc as needed.

### Templates (assets/templates/)

Embedded templates used by Claude Code during specification generation:

- **`requirements.md`** - Structure for feature requirements with sections for problem statement, solution overview, functional/technical requirements, acceptance criteria, and constraints
- **`implementation-plan.md`** - Structure for technical plans with milestones, phases, tasks, code examples, and deployment considerations designed to guide supervised implementation with Claude Code
- **`context.md`** - Template for context gathering sessions used to create both `context-requirements.md` and `context-implementation-plan.md` files

Templates can be localized to `.spec/templates/` for project-specific customization using `specware localize-templates`.

### Specification Artifacts (.spec/)

Generated specification files organized in numbered feature directories:

**Generated Files:**
- **`requirements.md`** - Final requirements specification filled from template
- **`implementation-plan.md`** - Final implementation plan with detailed tasks and code examples to guide supervised implementation with Claude Code  
- **`context-requirements.md`** - Q&A context and codebase research for requirements phase
- **`context-implementation-plan.md`** - Q&A context and technical analysis for implementation phase
- **`.spec-status.json`** - Current workflow status and progress tracking

**Directory Structure:**
```
.spec/
  001-user-auth/           # Sequential numbering
  002-dashboard/
  003-notifications/
```

All files are ignored by git by default to keep specifications separate from source code.

#### Status Tracking

Features are tracked through `.spec-status.json` files within a feature spec directory (`.spec/000-example-feature/`) with suggested workflow phases:
- `"Requirements Gathering"`
- `"Requirements Context Gathering"`
- `"Requirements Expert Q&A"`
- `"Requirements Complete"`
- `"Requirements Interactive Review"`
- `"Implementation Planning"`
- `"Implementation Plan Q&A"`
- `"Implementation Plan Generated"`
- `"Implementation Plan Interactive Review"`
- `"Implementation Planning Complete"`

There is no validation or expectation that state values match this list.

## üéØ Guiding Principles

**Reduce reliance on the LLM**
- Extract operations that need to be consistent and repeatable to traditional code
- Extract output expectations to templates
- Extract state tracking to structured metadata
- Reduce token consumption and time spent waiting on inference

**Be un-intrusive**
- Do not create any artifacts that will not be ignored by git in default configurations
- Create the minimal amount of spec artifacts, commands, templates, etc.
- Do not force specific workflows

**Allow for customization**
- Teams and individuals will have specific preferences, enable project-specific customization where possible
- Provide sensible defaults

**Single assistant focus**
- Enable a single coding assistant (Claude Code) to avoid complexity
