# Specware Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Basic structure

Create the `specware` tool in golang. Use the cobra library. Use a directory structure that puts command-related files in cmd/ and implementation specifics in either internal/ or pkg/.

Add the sub-commands as specified in the spec, but they do nothing but output "Not yet implemented".

Add a simple README.md file.

Add a Makefile supporting `make build` that builds the tool.

## Phase 2: Template and Claude Command creation
Add the .claude/commands directory and command files with a basic summary/workflow structure.

Add the templates/ direcotry and create the necessary templates in this directory. They should remain simple for now, containing one-sentence descriptions of each section within the section and only a few sections.

## Phase 3: Init sub-command

Implement the `init` sub-command functionality to create the spec files and copy the commands into the specified directory.

Add testing using ginkgo to validate all functionality.
